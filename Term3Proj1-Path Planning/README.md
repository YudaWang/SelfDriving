# Path Planning Project

## The goals / requirements of this project are:

* Design a path planner that is able to create smooth, safe paths for the car to follow along a 3 lane highway with traffic.

## Project Specs

### 1. Compilation

* C++ scripts are compilable and executable to run simulator.

### 2. Valid Trajectories

![alt text][image1]

* The car is able to drive at least 4.32 miles without incident.

* The car drives according to the speed limit.

* Max Acceleration and Jerk are not Exceeded.

* Car does not have collisions.

* The car stays in its lane, except for the time between changing lanes.

* The car is able to change lanes.

## Reflection / Documentation

### Path finding control process:

-- Motion sensing: 

- The host vehicle's current position, speed and planned future path waypoints can be acquired by its own sensing feedback. 

- All other vehicle's current location and speed can be acquired by sensor fusion information.

-- Speed control: 

- Host vehicle top speed has been capped at 49.5mps to ensure it never exceed 50mps limit. 

- If there is no car's 1sec future loction within 30m in front of host vehicle's 1sec future location, host vehicle shall accelerate until top speed.

- If there is car's 1sec future location within 30m in front of host vehicle's 1sec future location, hose vehicle shall decelerate if there are similar cars at host vehicle's both left and right lane, otherwise lane change is required.

-- Lane control:

- If there is no car's 1sec future location within 30m in front of host vehicle's 1sec future location, hose vehicle shall keep its lane.

- If there is car's 1sec future location within 30m in front of host vehicle's 1sec future location, host vehicle shall make a lane change if either left or right lane doesn't contain such vehicle that its 1sec future s-value within 30m in front of host vehicle's 1sec future s-value.

- If there is car's 1sec future location within 30m in front of host vehicle's 1sec future location, but both left and right lanes contain such vehicle that its 1sec future s-value within 30m in front of host vehicle's 1sec future s-value, or left or right lane is outside of limit, host vehicle shall keep its lane.

-- Path generation and execution:

- Path points are generated by setpoints spline fit, where setpoints are chosen based on the speed/lane control results, and spline fit is used to interpolate the control coerse points so finer steps of path points are acquired.

- Path execution is completed by driving host vehicle thru path points one at a time.
